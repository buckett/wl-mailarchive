Note - the conversion worked before K1 and fails after K1.

The code works when it comes up with autoDDL.

If you really need ot run the conversion - the scripts should
work in a 2-5-x.

Hopefully when Ian gets back from holiday we will 
get the jars mapped to the post-K1 jars and the conversion
will again work.
